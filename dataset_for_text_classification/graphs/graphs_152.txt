The well-known programmer Văndămel has at his disposal a binary matrix with n lines (numbered from 1 to n) and m columns (numbered from 1 to m). Văndămel can perform, as often as possible, the following operation: choose two neighboring positions on a row or column that both contain the value 1 and turn them into 0. Văndămel knows how to solve any matrix problem, but he wants to see if you can also you will find the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed on the given matrix.
