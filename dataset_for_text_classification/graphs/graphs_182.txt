After the ninja heroes defeated Nadakhan, on the day of the missing Zane had to guard the n dolls in the museum. Between these dolls there are m corridors on which you can travel in both directions. It is guaranteed that on the m corridors Zane can reach each of the n dolls. Skulkiu, having at his disposal 5 types of obstacles A, B, C, D, E, tries to stop Zane by placing 4 obstacles in each corridor. Zane can destroy type A, B, C and D obstacles, but cannot destroy type E obstacles. To destroy an obstacle type A Zane's weapon needs 1 unit of energy, to destroy an obstacle type B of 2 units of energy, to destroy an obstacle of type C of 3 units of energy, and to destroy an obstacle of type D of 4 units of energy. Due to the device with which Skulkiu places obstacles in the corridor, the four obstacles in the same corridor are of increasing depth, implying that it takes 5 times more energy to destroy the second obstacle placed in the corridor the usual one, to destroy the third obstacle located on the corridor it takes 25 times more energy than the usual one, and to destroy the fourth obstacle located on the same corridor it takes 125 times more energy than the usual one . Regardless of which way Zane travels down the corridor to clear the obstacles, the energy consumed is the same, depending only on the order in which the obstacles were placed by Skulkiu. Zane will not remove obstacles from all corridors but only the ones necessary to gain access to each doll. Zane wants to let the other ninjas train so he makes it so that the help to destroy the E-type obstacles is minimal and then he uses a minimal number of energy units. For corridors with type E obstacles Zane only consumes energy for type A, B, C and D obstacles. Initially Zane is next to doll 1.
