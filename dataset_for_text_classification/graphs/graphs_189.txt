The town hall of Iasi decided to modernize the roads in the locality. A road is a stretch of road that joins two intersections. The construction company did a study to determine the costs for each road. Funds are limited, so in the first phase only the roads near Palas, which are at junction number 1, will be upgraded. More precisely: any upgraded road must be at least as close to Palas as any road that it will not be modernized.
