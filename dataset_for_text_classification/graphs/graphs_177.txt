Mihai, being a big fan of outdoor games, invented a new game in the hope that he will convince his colleagues to go outside and play. Mihai's game says that there are N squares located at certain levels and from each square you can only jump to certain squares established at the beginning of the game. If a player jumps from a square at level X to a square at a higher level Y, he uses an effort equal to [Y/X], and if he jumps to a square at a lower level or equals Y, the effort used is [X/Y]. The player is initially in the start square S and the goal of the game is to get to the end square F with minimal effort.
