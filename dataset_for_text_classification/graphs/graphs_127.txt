The peasant Ion has N trees in his orchard, each with vines of apples. There are N-1 paths between the trees, so that between any two trees there is only one path, possibly consisting of several paths. Because he has not paid his installments to the bank, he is forced to sell part of the trees. He wants to collect the apples from the orchard, but because he doesn't have much time, he will only collect the apples from part of the trees.
