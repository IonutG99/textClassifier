A KST is a search tree that has K values ​​in each node and each node has K+1 children. For example, for k=1, a KST becomes a binary search tree. The values ​​in each node are in ascending order. We denote by v[i], the i-th value from a node. The tree has the following property: for each node, its first child will have values ​​less than v[1], the second will have values ​​belonging to the range (v[1], v[2]), the third will have values ​​from the range ( v[2], v[3]), …, penultimate child in the range (v[k-1], v[k]), the last one will have values ​​greater than v[k]. A node cannot have children if it does not contain K values. Leaves can have even less than K values. Given N – the number of elements and K, it is necessary to find out how many trees that meet the requirement exist.
