Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge costs 1 (can be traversed in one minute). Two "friends" (cousins) start from node S. One of them wants to reach node A and the other wants to reach node B. What is the minimum number of minutes required so that it is possible for both of them to reach their destinations them, in the allotted time, in A and B, respectively?
