In the communication course organized during the holiday, N people participated, numbered with serial numbers from 1 to N. Each person has several close friends at the course, to whom they communicate any information as soon as they learn it. Communication relationships are not bidirectional, in other words if person a immediately transmits information to person b, it is not mandatory that person b immediately transmits the information he receives to person a.
