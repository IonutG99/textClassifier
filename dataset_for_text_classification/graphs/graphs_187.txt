Jimmy's company has n flower farms. For each plantation, the type of cultivated flowers is known, i.e. how many tons of flowers were produced this year. It is known that flower plantations are connected by n - 1 roads such that each plantation can be reached from any other plantation and there is only one way to get from plantation x to plantation y , for every 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n .We also know the distance in km for each of the n - 1 roads. Jimmy wants to bring all flowers of the same type to the same place with minimum shipping cost. If we have a tons of flowers and want to send them over a distance of b kilometers, the transportation cost is a * b. For each type of flower, Jimmy wants to determine the minimum transportation cost to bring all flowers of the same type to one place.
