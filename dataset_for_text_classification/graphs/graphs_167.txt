It is known that in a connected undirected graph, between any two vertices there is at least one chain and the length of a chain is equal to the number of edges that compose it. We define the notion of an optimal chain between two vertices X and Y as a chain of minimum length that has as its extremities the vertices X and Y. It is obvious that between any two vertices of a connected graph we will have one or more optimal chains, depending on the configuration of the graph . Given a connected undirected graph with N vertices labeled with order numbers 1, 2, …, N and two of its vertices denoted X and Y (1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N, X≠Y ), you are required to write a program which determines the vertices that belong to all optimal chains between X and Y.
