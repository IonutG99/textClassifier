Pejorel took up fruit growing and planted a tree (acyclic connected graph) with N nodes, each node having a given color from an interval [1, K]. Now, after the tree has grown, he wants to know, for each color, the sum of the distances between all pairs of nodes in the tree that have that color. The distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges on the road between the two nodes. Because Peony used a lot of fertilizer when planting the tree, it grew a lot and you have to write a program that calculates the sum of the distances between the nodes of the same color.
