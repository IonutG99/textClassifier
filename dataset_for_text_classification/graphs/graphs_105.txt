In a company there are n employees, numbered from 1 to n, organized hierarchically, so that each employee has a direct boss, except for the general manager, who does not have a boss. Each employee of the company has a known salary, expressed by a natural number. In the company, an employee reward system works so that the earnings of each employee are equal to his salary plus the arithmetic average of the earnings of his direct subordinates. Exceptions are made by employees who do not have direct subordinates, for whom the earnings are equal to the salary.
