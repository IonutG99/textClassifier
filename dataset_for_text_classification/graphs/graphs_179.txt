n people are invited to a wedding, numbered from 1 to n. It is known that some of them know each other two by two, either they are relatives, or from work, or they are friends or neighbors. Thus, a minimum number K of groups will be formed so that in each group, each person has at least one acquaintance. For each group of at least two people, a leader is established - the person with the minimum order number. These groups will be numbered 1 to K in ascending order of the leaders' order numbers. In order to avoid embarrassing situations as much as possible, the wedding organizer would like to arrange a main table with at least n/2+1 guests, at which one or more such whole groups numbered with consecutive values ​​will be seated.
