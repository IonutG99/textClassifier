We are given a tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. The tree will transform as follows: at any stage every node of degree 1 different from the root in the current tree is replaced by a tree identical to the originally given one, and at the next stage the process will be repeated for the obtained tree, thus forming an infinite tree. The images show an example of the initial tree, the tree obtained after the first stage of leaf extension and the tree obtained after two stages of leaf extension. Determine how many nodes are at a distance D from the root of the infinite tree.
