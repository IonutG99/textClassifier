Let a = a1, a2, …, aN be a sequence of natural numbers, not necessarily distinct, between 1 and N. Let also be two natural numbers x and y. The transform(i) operation is defined as follows: the value w = 1 + (x * i + y * ai) mod N is determined, then all elements equal to ai in the sequence ai, ai+1, …, aN change their value to w . After each transform type operation, the sum of the elements of the obtained string is calculated. Determine the maximum amount obtained in the string a by performing the operations transform(1), transform(2), ..., transform(N) on the string.
