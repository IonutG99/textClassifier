A new computer game has just been released. You are a space explorer in a universe with N planets, each one has a teleporter to another planet meaning that from the current planet you can go to the planet where you can teleport. Links are one-way. The question is, if you were now on planet i, how many teleportation routes would you need to use to get to a planet you've already been to. This value must be calculated for each planet.
