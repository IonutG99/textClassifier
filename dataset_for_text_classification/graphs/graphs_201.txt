Emilian is an illustrious doctor in neurosurgery, who has just opened a clinic in the city of Sf√Æantul Genesius. Since he is known throughout the city as the best neurosurgeon in the country, there are always a lot of requests from patients who want to be scheduled for a consultation. Because he is normally very busy, he lets the clinic's secretariat handle the appointments. Unfortunately, all the secretarial staff are away on holiday fixed during the busiest time of the year and so Emilian asks for your help to schedule his patients. One day he receives requests from N patients, and to make it easier for him to make his schedule, Emilian allowed each patient to propose only two moments of time in which he could be called for a consultation. Knowing that Emilian's staff is away for T days, and each day Emilian has other patients to schedule, help him decide for each day whether or not he can schedule all the patients for that day.
