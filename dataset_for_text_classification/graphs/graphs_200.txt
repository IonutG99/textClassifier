K dwarves, numbered from 1 to K, live at the top of Mount Acrom during the summer. There are N cabins on the mountain, located at different altitudes, connected by M paths. The dwarves' cabin is numbered 1, and the cabin at the foot of the mountain is numbered N. Because the winter is too cold, the dwarves move to the cabin at the foot of the mountain, where it is warmer. The dwarves are disciplined and descend from the mountain in ascending order of their numbers. Write a program that determines the length of the path chosen by each dwarf, a path that respects the conditions in the statement.
