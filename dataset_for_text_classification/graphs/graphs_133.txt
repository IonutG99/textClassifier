Somewhere, in a distant land, a famous company, namely Mondial Computers SRL, operates. They work with many big-name clients, so they need a lot of manpower. Thus, they have a database where they maintain information about their employees, but recently the team handling this database has shown poor performance, and as a result, the general manager has decided , without taking into account the consequences, to fire them, and they, out of anger, deleted all the employees' data before leaving the company. Now the manager needs your help (voluntarily, of course) to reorganize this database until he succeeds in hiring new people.
