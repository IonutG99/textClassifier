A connected graph with N nodes and M edges can be viewed as an hourglass centered at node X, 1 ≤ X ≤ N, if we can divide all nodes, minus node X, into two nonempty subsets such that any path from a node from one set to a node in the other set passes through node X. You need to determine the number of distinct ways in which we can view the graph as an hourglass for each of the N nodes chosen as the center, modulo 666013. Two ways are considered distinct if the two related subsets are different. The order of subsets in a mode is relevant, but the order of nodes within a set is not. For example, the solutions ({1,2,3}, {4,5}) and ({4,5}, {1,2,3}) are distinct, but the solutions ({4,5}, {1, 2,3}) and ({4,5}, {1,3,2}) are not distinct.
