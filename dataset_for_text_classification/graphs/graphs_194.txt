Florin is back in Drobeta-Turnu Severin. Unfortunately, he did not get rid of the pickpockets who cause him so many problems! They even followed him here! However, he found out how to get rid of them. Drobeta-Turnu Severin is a city in the form of an acyclic directed graph with n nodes and m edges. For the thieves to lose track of him, Florin (who is in node 1) must reach node n by a certain route. He managed to obtain a list A with p nodes. On his way from 1 to n he must go through these p nodes in the order in which they are given, otherwise he will not escape the thieves! Find the number of possible paths from 1 to n such that they pass through the p nodes in the order in which they are given. Because the result can be very large, the remainder of dividing it by 1,000,000,007 will be displayed.
