In the ONI realm there are N kingdoms connected to each other by M bidirectional edges. It is guaranteed to be possible to get from any kingdom to any other kingdom using these edges. These kingdoms want to make alliances with each other and will use border points to achieve this. Each edge i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ M, has associated a natural number c[i] representing the cost of constructing a border point on it. Moreover, each kingdom i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N, has associated a natural number r[i] representing the cost of building a border point at its entrance. For each kingdom you have to calculate the cost it has to pay to be in a perfect alliance. In other words, for each kingdom i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N, you must calculate &amp;#x2211;j=1,j&amp;#x2260;iNCost(i,j)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">∑Nj=1,j≠iCost(i,j)∑j=1,j≠iNCost(i,j) \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^{N} \mathit{Cost }(i, j) .
