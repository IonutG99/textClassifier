Given a tree (acyclic connected graph) with N nodes. We want to remove nodes (along with adjacent edges) from the given tree such that the number of connected components of the remaining graph is maximal. Find the maximum number of connected components we can get and how many distinct subsets of nodes can be removed from the tree so that this maximum number of connected components remains at the end.
