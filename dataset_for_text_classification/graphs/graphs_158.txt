After a productive day of cleaning, Henry and Hetty went out to a sushi restaurant. In this restaurant, there are N tables joined together by N-1 two-way conveyor belts, so that any two tables are connected directly or indirectly by conveyor belts. For each table i, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, we know both the number K[i] of tables with which it is directly connected, and the ordered list of tables neighboring it: V[i,1], V[i,2] … V [i,K[i]].
