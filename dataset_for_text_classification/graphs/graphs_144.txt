In a certain country there are n cities, numbered from 1 to n, between which there are one-way roads. The president of the country wants to make a multi-city electoral visit as follows: he lands by helicopter in city p, travels to city q using the existing road network, from where he departs by helicopter. Politically some cities are safe (ruled by the president's political allies), others are unsafe (ruled by adversaries), and the president only wants to go through safe cities.
