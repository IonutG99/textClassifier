Representatives of several states participate in a dinner. Each representative knows a number of foreign languages. Two representatives will be able to discuss directly if there is at least one language that they both understand. The organizers of the dinner want to have at least one table where there is no need for a translator, so that any two people sitting at this table can understand each other directly.
