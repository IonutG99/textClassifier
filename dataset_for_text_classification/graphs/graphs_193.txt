Gustavo, after realizing that he possessed the ability to see into the future, decided it was time to take it to the next level and harness his extrasensory abilities. In order to gain prestige and become better known among professional magicians, he chose to debut at the National Informatics Olympiad by predicting the input data for certain problems proposed in the competition. Gustavo's first client, Alfredo, would like to find out in a novel way the contents of an input file related to a competition problem, in which the elements of a string p of N integers are written. To make things more interesting, Gustavo charges him a fee of C(i,j) pennies to reveal to him the sum of the numbers in the string p with indices in the interval [i, j], namely pi + pi+1 + ... + pj . Given the value of N and all values ​​of C(i,j) with 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N, determine the minimum total cost that Alfredo must pay to learn all elements of the string p.
