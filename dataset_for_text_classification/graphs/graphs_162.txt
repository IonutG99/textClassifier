During the World Championship in Brazil, an increase in coffee traffic is expected. It is known that there are N cities, connected by N-1 bidirectional streets, so that one can get from any city to another. Currently there are K coffee cartels located in distinct cities, each exerting influence in their own city. It is known that each of these cartels wants to expand its influence in neighboring cities. Thus, at some point in time, a cartel can extend its influence in a neighboring city only if it is not under the influence of another cartel. Once a cartel expands its influence in a new city, the cartel can expand its influence in neighboring cities as well. It is known that until the start of the world championship, every city will be under the influence of a cartel.
