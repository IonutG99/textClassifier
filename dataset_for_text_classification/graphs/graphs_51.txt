In our galaxy there are n planets, numbered from 1 to n. Bidirectional warp jumps of known durations are calculated and known between some of them, there are m such warp jumps in total. Through these warp jumps, the possibility of navigation between any two planets is ensured, directly or through several intermediate warp jumps. Starfleet makes very efficient use of these jumps, that is, it uses routes consisting of one or more warp jumps so that the duration obtained as the sum of the durations of the component warp jumps is always minimal.
