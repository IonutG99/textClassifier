Zăhărel and Sică thought of reinventing themselves from a spiritual point of view. In the first phase, they want to move to the city of Sala. The city of Sala contains N houses (numbered from 1 to N) connected by M two-way streets of equal length. They have limited funds at their disposal and can only move into a border neighborhood consisting of X houses. Since they are good friends, the two want to move into two separate houses, as close as possible to each other. Determine the minimum distance between two distinct houses from X in the neighborhood.
