To test a new topology, a network of computers was built in which each computer transmits information unidirectionally to a single computer in the network. We call a connection an ordered pair of computers, not necessarily distinct, in which the first is the one that sends the information and the second is the one that receives it directly. Given such a network and the existing connections between the computers that make it up, determine the subset with the maximum number of feedback-computers. A feed-back computer has the property that the information that starts from it reaches, through successive connections, back to the computer from which it started.
