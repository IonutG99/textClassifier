Given a digraph (directed graph) with n nodes numbered from 1 to n. The connected hard components graph is obtained as follows: construct the connected hard components, then each such component becomes a node in the new graph. Then, from the initial list of arcs, only arcs that have endpoints in different hard connected components are kept in the new graph. Display the adjacency lists associated with the new digraph.
