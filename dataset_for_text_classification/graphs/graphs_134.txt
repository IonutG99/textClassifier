Given a tree with N nodes and the root in node 1 whose edges have lengths expressed by non-zero natural numbers and Q queries of the form u v. For each query find the sum of the lengths of all distinct paths from a node located in the subtree rooted at node u to a node in the subtree rooted at node v modulo 109+7" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">109+7109+7 {10}^{9} + 7 ( the length of a road is equal to the sum of the lengths of all the edges that make it up).
