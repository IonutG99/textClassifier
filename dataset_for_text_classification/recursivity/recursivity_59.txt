After realizing that you can't beat any of the monsters (from the SAO issue), you decided to retire and become a farmer. From the money for the purchase of the equipment, you bought a parcel coded in the form of a matrix of n lines and m columns, for each area its fertility is known. Since you don't have money to cultivate the land, you want to select a plot where all areas have the same fertility and the total fertility is maximum. The total fertility of a parcel is equal to the sum of the fertility of the areas that make up that parcel.
