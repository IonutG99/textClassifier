Once upon a time, there was a kingdom in ruins because of its evil ruler. Stung by complaints from the locals, the king decides to hire a servant, named Phil, in the hope that he will do his job and solve the citizens' grievances about the number of green spaces and properties. Since the tasks are quite difficult for the persistent Phil, he turns to you for help. He asks you to write a program that reads the natural numbers n, m and the matrix representing the map and determines: 1) the integer part r of the ratio of the area of ​​the royal palace to that of Phil's house; 2) the absolute value d of the difference between the number of green areas and the number of vacation homes of the king.
