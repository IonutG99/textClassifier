A group of climbers, on the edge of a cliff on a slope, are caught in the middle of a storm. To shelter, they must find a hillside shelter area consisting of contiguous safe spaces to the N, E, S, and W, large enough to accommodate the entire group. The climbers have cameras mounted on their helmets that send a live video to a team of mountain rescue programmers. Computer scientists manage to analyze the safe spaces of the slope. They ask for your help to save the climbers.
