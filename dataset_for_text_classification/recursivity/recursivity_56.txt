On a continent represented by a matrix of n rows and m columns are several states, all in conflict. Thus, everyone mobilized their army. Each array element represents a region. Two elements, from the matrix, adjacent on the line or on the column (not on the diagonal) represent two regions that belong to the same state. An element of the matrix containing the number 0 is a neutral region that delimits the states and has no soldiers. The element containing a non-zero number c is a region that belongs to a state and has c soldiers. Determine the maximum number S of soldiers in a state of the continent as well as the minimum number R of regions that a state with S soldiers can have.
