A farmer has a plot of land that is shaped like a rectangular array of N x M units. Trees are planted here and there on the land, which the farmer does not want to cut. Wanting to supervise his crop, the farmer makes a small square-shaped robot with a side of 3 units that he can teleguide around the farm, covering a certain area unit by unit. The robot can move vertically and horizontally, but it cannot go over trees, destroy them, rotate, and needs a surface corresponding to its size for movement. Help the farmer determine the maximum area he can track using this system.
