It is considered a military polygon, on which a system of xOy coordinate axes is established. There are n bombs, numbered from 1 to n, for each of which the x y coordinates and the destruction power p are known. When a bomb of power p explodes, everything inside and on the circle of center x y and radius p will be destroyed, and if there are other bombs in this area, they will explode in turn.
