To obtain the Philosopher's Stone, an alchemist prepared an elixir using a crucible of capacity C, into which he poured drops of molten metal, in a well-established order, in N stages. The number of drops poured in a stage is between 0 and C-1, and the process starts when the first drop has been poured into the crucible (in the first stage the number of drops poured is zero). The drops are collected in the crucible one by one, and each time the crucible is completely filled, the alchemist utters a magic formula, causing the entire contents to transform into a single drop, then continues the process. A recipe for obtaining the elixir is expressed by a string of N numbers, representing the number of drops poured in the N stages.
