The village of Binăreni is in danger following the fires caused in the last month. This is represented by a binary matrix with N rows and M columns. All cells that have caught fire are represented by the value 0. All cells in which there is no fire, represented by values ​​of 1, initially contain one house of a villager. Gosu, the most famous fireman in the village, wants to save all the houses that are not in "safe" cells by using his superpower: he can put out the fire once in all the cells that caught fire on an x-line and all cells that caught fire on a y column, placing at their intersection, in cell (x, y). It can be placed on either a fire cell or a cell containing a house. Since Gosu can only use his superpower once, find all the possible pairs of (x, y) coordinates that he can place himself on so that he can save all the houses that are in danger.
