Gigel and Ionel are playing spies! That's why they imagine a way to encode a message so that no one can decipher it. All their messages are a power of 2 in length. They number the letters of the message starting with 1. They then separate the letters into two categories: odd-numbered ones on the left, even-numbered ones on the right, keeping their order. The process continues for each new resulting group starting with the one on the left, until each obtained group contains only one character. After finishing the operations, paste the resulting groups of one letter each, starting from left to right, and get the coded message.
