Along the boulevard are n trees, numbered from 1 to n, for each of which the height, expressed in centimeters, is known. The mayor wants to cut down the trees and calls on a sorcerer who will proceed as follows: he chooses a sequence of neighboring trees as long as possible and applies a spell by which the height of all the trees in the sequence decreases by the same, strictly positive value. Determine the minimum number of spells that must be cast so that all trees have zero height.
