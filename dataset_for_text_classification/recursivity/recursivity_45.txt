Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and prepares presents for the good children of Class X B, helped by several elves. Due to global warming, the ice is melting, forming more icebergs. Elves on other floes than Santa can no longer help him. Santa must choose an iceberg to wrap the presents on. For technical reasons, Santa has to choose only one icicle, and he will choose it so that he can be helped by as many elves as possible.
