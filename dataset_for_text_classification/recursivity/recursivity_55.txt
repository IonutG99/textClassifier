On a continent represented by a matrix with n lines and m columns, there are several states, all of them in conflict. Thus, everyone mobilized their army. Matrix elements store one digit each. Two adjacent elements on the line or column (not on the diagonal) belong to the same state and are called regions. A position in the matrix containing the digit 0 is a neutral region and has no soldiers, and the position containing a non-zero digit belongs to a state and has c soldiers. Determine the region with the most soldiers in the state with the most soldiers.
