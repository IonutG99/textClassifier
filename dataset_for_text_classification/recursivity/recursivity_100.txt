Alina is passionate about black and white photos. She chose an image that she binary coded into an n x m matrix with values ​​of 0 corresponding to white (which she called light points) and values ​​of 1 corresponding to black (which she called dark points ). Thus, it identifies bright areas and dark areas in the coded image, an area being a portion of the matrix that contains elements with the same value, the transition from one element to another of the area being made only by horizontal or vertical movements. Help Alina find the brightest area and determine the number of its bright points.
