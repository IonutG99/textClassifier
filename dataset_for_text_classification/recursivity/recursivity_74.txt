Write the complete definition of a recursive C++ function that takes as parameters a natural number n, an increasing array X of real numbers with n elements, and a real number v and that returns the position in the array where the value v occurs. If v does not occurs in the string, the value -1 will be returned. If v occurs in more than one position in the string, one of these will be returned.
