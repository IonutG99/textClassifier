In the game Among Us a crew tries to pilot a space shuttle. Some of them are trying to sabotage the mission. These "imposters" are usually dangerous and so astronauts (or "crewmates") must avoid them as much as possible. The astronauts studied the interior plan of the shuttle and found that it is divided into nxm cabins, arranged in n rows, m in each row. They created a matrix of codes by associating each booth with a number from the set {0,1,2}. Help the crew by marking every safe and accessible cabin on the shuttle!
