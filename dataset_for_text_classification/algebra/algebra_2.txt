On  we consider the algebraic operation: xoy = axy + b(x + y) + c (a, b, c ). Prove that: (i) The operation "o" is associative  b2-b-ac = 0; (ii) If b2-b-ac = 0, then the operation "o" has a neutral element if and only if b | c. 1.4. Let M be a nonempty set and "o" an associative algebraic operation on M. Prove that: H = {a M: (x o a) o y = x o (a o y), for any x,y  M} is a stable part of M in relation to the given operation.
