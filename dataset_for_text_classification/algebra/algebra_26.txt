Let M 1, M 2 be monoids, f,g : M 1 M 2 two morphisms of monoids, Mf,g= {xM1: f(x) = g(x)} and i : M f,g  M1 inclusion morphism. Prove that: (i) M f,g is a submonoid of M 1 and f oi = empty; (ii) If M is another monoid and i  : M  M 1 is a morphism of monoids a.. f oi = goi, then there is a unique morphism of monoids u : M  Mf,g a.. iou = i. Notice. The doublet (M f,g, i) is denoted by Ker(f,g) and is called the kernel of the pair of monoid morphisms (f,g ). If g is the null morphism (g(x) = 1, ( ) xM1), we write Ker(f) = Mf,1 = {xM1 : f(x) = 1} and call it the kernel of f.
