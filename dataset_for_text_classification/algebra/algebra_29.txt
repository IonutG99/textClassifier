Let M 1,M2 be monoids, f : M 1M2 a morphism of monoids. We consider the following statements: (i) f is a surjective application; (ii) If M 3 is another monoid and g,h :M 2 M 3 are morphisms of monoids a.. g of = hof, then g = h . Prove that (i)  (ii) but in general (ii) (i). Notice. A morphism that verifies (ii) is called an epimorphism of monoids. 2. Group. Subgroup. Subgroup generated by a crowd. Calculations in a group.
