Let G 1, G 2 be two groups, f,g : G 1  G2 be group morphisms, G = {xG1 : f(x) = g(x)} and i : G  G1 the canonical inclusion. Prove that G  G1 and that the doublet (G,i) verifies the following universality property: (i) leaves = empty; (ii) If G is another group, i  : G  G1 a morphism of groups a.. foi = goi, then there is a unique morphism of groups u : G   G a.. i ou = i. Notice. The doublet (G,i) is denoted by Ker(f,g) and is called the kernel of the pair of morphisms (f,g).
