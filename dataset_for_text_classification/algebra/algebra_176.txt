Let G 1, G 2 be two groups, f : G 1  G2 a morphism of groups. Prove that the following statements are equivalent: (i) f is a surjective application; (ii) If G3 is another group and g,h : G 2  G3 are morphisms of groups a.. g of = hof, then g = h. Note. This exercise shows us that in the category of groups, epimorphisms are exactly surjective morphisms.
