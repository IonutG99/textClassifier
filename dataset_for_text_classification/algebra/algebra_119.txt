Let it be a prime number, Sn,   e. Suppose that in the decomposition of  into disjoint cycles, 1 cycles of length m 1, 2 cycles of length m 2,  , t cycles of length m t appear (m 1, m 2, , m t being distinct two by two) and m 1, m 2,  ,m k (k  t) are divisible by p. Prove that the equation xp =  has solutions tion in S n  1,2,  , k are divisible by p. Application. To study the compatibility of the equations: x2 = 1014189 17154 1613191211321876519181716151413121110987654321 in S 19; x3 = 4 102871956310987654321 in S 10.
