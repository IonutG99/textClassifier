Adrian III is a sorcerer prince. On November 4, the day of witchcraft, he wanted to impress Norela, the girl of his dreams. He has n playing cards, which are initially lined up face down on a table. Adrian has m magics at his disposal, one magic being of the form: q a1 a2 ..., aq. During a spell, the cards with clues a1 a2 ..., aq will be turned over in turn and in order. (numbers are distinct two by two). The card will be turned regardless of whether it is face up or face down (if it is face up it will turn face down and if it is face down it will turn face up), and each spell can be used at most once. Help Adrian impress Norela before his nemesis Manea the Eyebrow! Find the minimum number of spells that must be used so that at the end all the cards are face up. Also tell which mages were used. If there are several solutions, the least lexicographic one will be displayed.
