The map of a mountain is represented by a matrix with n lines and m columns where each element represents the height of the respective area. A climber starts at coordinates (1,1) and wants to reach coordinates (n,m). Movement is done on the same line or column; the climber can move from the current zone to the neighboring zone only if the height of the current zone is less than or equal to that of the neighboring zone.
