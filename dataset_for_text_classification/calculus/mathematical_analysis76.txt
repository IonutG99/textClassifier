1.4 Open Problems
“Obvious” is the most dangerous word in mathematics.
Eric Temple Bell (1883–1960)
In this section we collect several open problems that are motivated by some of the
exercises and problems from the previous sections. The ﬁrst problem is motivatedby Problem 1.51, with f(x)=x(1−x)being a function that attains its maximum at
1/2. Problem 1.80, which gives the behavior of a ﬁnite product, is closely related
to an exercise from the theory of inﬁnite series (see Problem 3.3), Problem 1.82 is
motivated by Problems 1.70 and1.71, and Problem 1.83 generalizes Problems 1.42
and
