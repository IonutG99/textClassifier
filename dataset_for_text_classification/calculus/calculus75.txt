10.1.2. Definition. Let \( f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) where \( A \subseteq \mathbb{R} \). The function \( f \) has a local (or relative) maximum at a point \( a \in A \) if there exists \( r > 0 \) such that \( f(a) \geq f(x) \) whenever \( |x - a| < r \) and \( x \in \text{dom } f \). It has a local (or relative) minimum at a point \( a \in A \) if there exists \( r > 0 \) such that \( f(a) \leq f(x) \) whenever \( |x - a| < r \) and \( x \in \text{dom } f \). The point \( a \) is a relative extremum of \( f \) if it is either a relative maximum or a relative minimum. The function \( f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is said to attain a maximum at \( a \) if \( f(a) \geq f(x) \) for all \( x \in \text{dom } f \). This is often called a global (or absolute) maximum to help distinguish it from the local version defined above. It is clear that every global maximum is also a local maximum but not vice versa. (Of course, similar definitions hold for global or absolute minima and global or absolute extrema.)
