Let $f(x) = \begin{cases} x + 4, & \text{if } x < -2 \\ -x, & \text{if } -2 < x < 1 \\ x^2 - 2x + 1, & \text{if } 1 < x < 3 \\ 10 - 2x, & \text{if } x > 3 \end{cases}$. (a) Is it possible to define $f$ at $x = -2$ in such a way that $f$ becomes continuous at $x = -2$? Answer: Yes. If so, then we should set $f(-2) = $. (b) Is it possible to define $f$ at $x = 1$ in such a way that $f$ becomes continuous at $x = 1$? Answer: No. If so, then we should set $f(1) = \underline{\phantom{answer}}$. (c) Is it possible to define $f$ at $x = 3$ in such a way that $f$ becomes continuous at $x = 3$? Answer: Yes. If so, then we should set $f(3) =$.
