10.1.3. Definition. A real-valued function \( f \) defined on an interval \( J \) is concave up on \( J \) if the chord line connecting any two points \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\) on the curve (where \( a, b \in J \)) always lies on or above the curve. It is concave down if the chord line always lies on or below the curve. A point on the curve where the concavity changes is a point of inflection. When \( f \) is twice differentiable, it is concave up on \( J \) if and only if \( f''(c) \geq 0 \) for all \( c \in J \), and it is concave down on \( J \) if and only if \( f''(c) \leq 0 \) for all \( c \in J \).
