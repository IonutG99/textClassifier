1.5 Hints
A hint is a word, or a paragraph, usually intended to help the
reader to ﬁnd a solution. The hint itself is not necessarily acondensed solution of the problem; it may just point to what Iregard as the heart of the matter.
Paul R. Halmos (1916–2006)
1.5.1 Miscellaneous Limits
Constants don’t vary—unless they are parameters.

1.1.1/(n+nα)≤1/(n+kα)≤1/(n+1)for 1≤k≤n.
1.2.Observe that 1 /2+2/3+···+n/(n+1)=n+1−γn+1−ln(n+1),where
γn+1=1+1/2+···+1/(n+1)−ln(n+1), and study the behavior of the logarithm
of the sequence in question.
