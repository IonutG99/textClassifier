Define \( f(x) = \begin{cases} (x^2)^x & \text{for } x \neq 0 \\ f(0) & \text{for } x = 0 \end{cases} \) To make \( f \) a continuous function on \( \mathbb{R} \), we need to find the value of \( f(0) \). To find the critical points of \( f \), we need to find the values of \( x \) where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or \( f'(x) \) does not exist. To determine the intervals on which \( f \) is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down, we need to analyze the sign and behavior of the first and second derivatives of \( f \). To find any points of inflection, we can use Newton's method to approximate the points where the concavity of the function changes.
